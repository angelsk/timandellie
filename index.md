<div class="safari">
  <p class="highlight">We are so excited to be seeing you all at our wedding! Having lived together for a few years now, we really do have everything we need, so there is no need to bring any gifts. If you do want to give something, then a contribution towards our honeymoon in South Africa would be incredible. We're going on safari which is something we've both wanted to do for such a long time, and it really does feel like a once in a lifetime opportunity. But as cliched as it sounds, you being at our wedding really is the most important thing to us so please do not feel like you have to do anything!<br /><br />
We have a honeymoon gift registry at <a href="https://www.honeyfund.com/Registry?id=862065&rid=754611&t=1">Honeyfund</a>.</p>
